# Pig Game Practice Project

Welcome to the "pig-game" repository! This project was created as part of my front-end development practice, with a focus on improving my skills in JavaScript. The objective of this project was to build a digital version of the Pig Game, a classic dice game that involves strategic decision-making and luck.

## Project Overview

The "pig-game" project involves the development of a digital Pig Game, where two players take turns rolling a dice and accumulating points. The goal is to reach a specified score before the opponent. The project progresses through various commits, each enhancing different aspects of the game.
